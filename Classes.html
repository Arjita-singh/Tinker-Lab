     <h2><u>PYTHON</u></h2>
     <p>Python is a programming language.It was created by Guido Van Rossum, and released in 1991 .<br>
       <b> It is used for </b>- <br> 1. Web Development<br> 
                         2. Software Development<br> 
                         3. Mathematics and System Scripting <br>
        <h3> Why Python? </h3>
         Python can be used on a server to create web applications. It is used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. 
         <h3>Python Syntax</h3>
        It was designed for readability. Unlike other languages Python uses new links to complete a command. It relies on indentation, using Whitespace to define scope such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. <br>
 Ex: [ printf("Hello, World") ]</p>
</div>

<div class="class">
  <h2><u>JAVA</u></h2>
      <p>Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.</p> 
<h3>What is Java Programming used for?</h3>
1. Game Development <br>
2. Cloud Computing<br>
3. Big Data<br>
4. Artificial Intelligence<br>
5. Internet of Things<br>
<h3>Why is Java such a popular choice among modern-day software developers?</h3>
1. High quality learning resources<br>
2. Inbuilt functions and libraries<br>
3. Active community support<br>
4. High-quality development tools<br>
5. Platform Independent<br>

  <h2><u>C Programming</u></h2>
    <p>C is a general-purpose procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was mainly created as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system.
<h3>Main features of C Language</h3>
  1. General Purpose and Portable<br>
 2. Procedural Programming Language<br>
  3.Low-level Memory Access<BR>
 4.Fast Speed<br>
  5. Clean Syntax<br>
<h2>Why learn C?</h2>
1. C is considered mother of all programming languages as many later languages like Java, PHP and JavaScript have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C.
2.It provides a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of programming.
<div class= "fanta">
<h3>First C code</h3>
#include <stdio.h><br>
int main(void)<br>
{<br>
    // This prints "Hello World"<br>
    printf("Hello World");<br>
    return 0;<br>
}

<h2><u>JAVASCRIPT</u></h2>
<p>JavaScript is a Client-Side and Server-Side Language,originally designed for client-side (browser) scripting.Now also used on the server-side via environments like Node.js.JavaScript is Interpreted and Dynamic. It’s interpreted, not compiled (though modern engines use JIT for performance).Dynamically typed – variables don’t need a type declared.Runs in the Browser.JavaScript can manipulate HTML/CSS using the DOM (Document Object Model). It supports event handling, form validation, animations, etc.
<h3>Why JavaScript?</h3>
1. Runs in Every Browser<br>
2. Essential for Web Development<br>
3. Full-Stack Development<br>
4. Huge Ecosystem<br>
5. Beginner-Friendly<br>
6. Asynchronous & Event-Driven<br>
7. Cross-Platform Applications<br>
8. Continuous Evolution<br>
9. Massive Job Market<br>
10. Powerful with the Right Tools.</p>

<h2><u>SQL</u></h2>
<p><h3>What is SQL?</h3>
1.SQL stands for Structured Query Language<br>
2.SQL lets you access and manipulate databases<br>
3.SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.
<h3>Using SQL in Your Web Site</h3>
<h4>To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:</h4>
1.An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)<br>
2.To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP<br>
3.To use SQL to get the data you want<br>
4.To use HTML / CSS to style the page<br>
<h3>What Can SQL do?</h3>
1.SQL can execute queries against a database<br>
2.SQL can retrieve data from a database<br>
3.SQL can insert records in a database<br>

<h2><u>C#</u></h2>
<p>C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 13, was released in November 2024.
<h3>C# is used for:</h3>
1.Mobile applications<br>
2.Desktop applications<br>
3.Web applications<br>
4.Web services<br>
5.Web sites<br>
<h3>Why Use C#?</h3>
1.It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.<br>
2.It is easy to learn and simple to use.<br>
3.It has huge community support.<br>
4.C# is an object-oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.<br>
5.As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa.<br>
